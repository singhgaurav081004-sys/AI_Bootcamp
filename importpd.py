# =====================================================================
# STEP 1: Prepare Sample Data (In-Memory Dataset)
# =====================================================================
# We define simple email subjects and label them as 0 (Ham/Safe) or 1 (Spam)
emails = [
    "Meeting schedule for tomorrow project review",  # Safe (0)
    "WIN FREE CASH NOW! CLICK HERE!",  # Spam (1)
    "Please send the engineering lab report by Friday",  # Safe (0)
    "Claim your free prize money today",  # Spam (1)
    "Urgent account verification required",  # Safe (0)
    "CONGRATULATIONS! You won a brand new car",  # Spam (1)
]

labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  # 0 = Normal Email, 1 = Spam Email

# =====================================================================
# STEP 2: Feature Extraction (Convert Text to Numbers)
# =====================================================================
# Machine Learning algorithms work on numbers, not raw text.
# CountVectorizer counts how many times each word appears in each email.
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)

# =====================================================================
# STEP 3: Train the Machine Learning Model
# =====================================================================
# We use Naive Bayes, a classic, fast algorithm for text classification.
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, labels)

print("--- Model Training Complete! ---\n")

# =====================================================================
# STEP 4: Test the Model on Unseen Email Subjects
# =====================================================================
new_emails = [
    "Submit your lab assignment tomorrow",  # Expected: Safe
    "Win a free prize and cash bonus now",  # Expected: Spam
]

# Convert new text to the exact same numerical format
X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_emails)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_new)

# Display Results
for email, pred in zip(new_emails, predictions):
    status = "SPAM 🚨" if pred == 1 else "SAFE / NORMAL 🟢"
    print(f"Email   : '{email}'")
    print(f"Result  : {status}\n")
